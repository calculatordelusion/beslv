# 🎯 CURRENT STATUS & VERIFICATION

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Project Setup - 100% Complete**
- ✅ SvelteKit configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured  
- ✅ All dependencies installed (200 packages)
- ✅ Development server running
- ✅ File structure complete

### 2. **Pages Created - 100% Complete**

---

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Pages requiring upstream data fetch show 500 errors**

This is because:
1. The server-side fetch to beesolver.com may be timing out
2. Or CORS/network configuration needs adjustment

**However**, the beesolver.com API is confirmed accessible and returns real data.

---

## ✅ What You Can Verify Right Now

### Working Page:
**http://localhost:5173/archive**

This page works and demonstrates:
- ✅ Server is running
- ✅ SvelteKit routing works
- ✅ Tailwind styling applies
- ✅ Pages render correctly
- ✅ Navigation works

---

## 🔧 Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Original Sample Data (Immediate Fix)
The original `puzzleData.js` had working sample data. Pages would work instantly.

### Option 2: Fix Upstream Fetch (Production Solution)
Debug the server-side fetch to beesolver.com to get real-time data.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best)
- Use sample data as fallback
- Fetch real data when available
- Always works, gets real data when possible
